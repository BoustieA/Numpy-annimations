The purpose of this small project is to experiment with NumPy and mathematical equations related to depth, projection, and rotation.

Here, I aim to create a simple animation by employing these concepts with optimization in mind. This involves utilizing the most efficient mathematical expressions for the problem to fully leverage NumPy's parallelism capabilities.
